# Lip-reading-by-CNN-and-LSTM-architecture

# Introduction

  This deep learning project is about Lip Reading which is a technique of understanding speech by visually interpreting the movements of the lips so, we implemented this Lip Reading by using deep learning. It can be used for hard-of hearing people or to get some information from video without sound.
  
## Objective

  Lip Reading relies on the kind of the language and, in this project, **we chose Hangul as the language to implement the Lip Reading**.
